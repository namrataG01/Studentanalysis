Project Overview

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a student-related dataset to understand patterns, trends, and key factors affecting student performance. The analysis is performed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate data analysis skills such as data cleaning, visualization, and insight generation, which are essential for a Data Analyst role.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas – data manipulation

NumPy – numerical operations

Matplotlib – data visualization

Seaborn – statistical visualizations

📂 Project Files

studentanalysis.ipynb – Main notebook containing complete analysis

README.md – Project documentation

🔍 Steps Performed in Analysis
1️⃣ Data Loading

Imported dataset into Pandas DataFrame

Checked dataset shape and structure

2️⃣ Data Understanding

Used .info() and .describe()

Identified data types and missing values

3️⃣ Data Cleaning

Handled missing values

Removed or treated outliers (if any)

Corrected data types

4️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution of student scores

Comparison based on gender / category (if available)

Subject-wise performance analysis

Correlation analysis

5️⃣ Data Visualization

Bar charts

Line charts

Histograms

Box plots

Correlation heatmap

📈 Key Insights

Identified factors impacting student performance

Observed score distribution trends

Found relationships between different variables

(Exact insights depend on dataset and are explained inside the notebook.)
